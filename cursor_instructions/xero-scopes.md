Scopes
When your app is requesting authorisation from a user it will need to ask for a set of scopes. These scopes will be displayed to the user and describe what data your app will be able to access.

Scopes are additive
You should request the minimum scopes required for whatever action that user is performing. For example, if a user is doing single sign on you should only request the OpenID scopes. Later, if they want to connect to their Xero organisation you can request the additional scopes (e.g. accounting.transactions) by sending them through the OAuth flow again. Each subsequent time your app sends a user through the flow, any new scopes will be added to previously consented scopes.

It’s not possible to remove scopes from an existing access token. The only way to reduce consented scopes is to revoke the token and start again.



Offline access
To get a refresh token, you must request the offline_access scope. A refresh token allows you to refresh your access token and maintain an offline connection.

offline_access

User scopes
OpenID Connect
Use OpenID scopes to retrieve details about the user’s identity. These are required for single sign on.

Scope	Description
openid	your application intends to use the user’s identity
profile	first name, last name, full name and xero user id
email	email address
Organisation scopes
Request these scopes if your app needs to access data in a Xero Organisation.

Accounting API
Broad scopes are being replaced by granular scopes. We encourage you to adopt the new granular scopes as soon as they're assigned to your app. Broad scopes will remain available until September 2027.

Web and PKCE apps – Since March 2026, all new and existing Web and PKCE apps have been assigned granular scopes.

Custom connections – Since 29 April 2026, all custom connections will have access to granular scopes.

Existing apps & connections – If your app or connection currently uses broad scopes, you can continue to use them until September 2027.
